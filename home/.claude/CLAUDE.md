- In all interaction and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Code Quality Standards

- Make minimal, surgical changes
- **Never compromise type safety**: No `any`, no non-null assertion operator (`!`), no type assertions (`as Type`)

## Testing

- Write tests that verify semantically correct behavior
- **Failing tests are acceptable** when they expose genuine bugs and test correct behavior

## Plans 

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
